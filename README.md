Hi

I'm Ivan

I research novel programming interfaces and make multimedia art. That's why my face is a dithered gory pizza.

At the moment, I

- work at [@inkandswitch](https://github.com/inkandswitch) as a researcher
- co-host the [@futureofcoding](https://github.com/futureofcoding) podcast
- record music as [Spiral Ganglion](https://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com)
- dream of [visual programming](https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/)

My [deeply personal website](https://ivanish.ca) is full of weird things I've done.

Finally, I enjoy [making new friends](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion) on Mastodon. Come say hi.

Best,

-I
