Hi

I'm Ivan

I research novel programming interfaces and make multimedia art. That's why my face is a dithered gory pizza.

At the moment, I

- work as a researcher at [@inkandswitch](https://github.com/inkandswitch)
- co-host the podcast [@futureofcoding](https://github.com/futureofcoding)
- record music as [Spiral Ganglion](https://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com)
- dream of [visual programming](https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/)

My [deeply personal website](https://ivanish.ca) is chock-full of weird things I've done. It's a deep web.

Oh, and I love making new friends on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/spiralganglion.com). Come say hi!

Best,

-I
